A fruiting block is a nutrient-rich, solid mass of substrate that has been fully colonized by mushroom mycelium, designed to support the final stage of mushroom growth, or fruiting. Typically made from sterilized or pasteurized materials like hardwood sawdust, straw, or agricultural byproducts, fruiting blocks are prepared in breathable bags with microfilter patches to allow gas exchange while preventing contamination. Once colonized, the block is removed from the bag or opened to expose the mycelium to fresh air, light, and proper humidity, triggering the mushrooms to grow from the surface.

### What you'll need
- Colonized fruiting block.
- A clean sharp object such as a knife or box cutter.
- Spray bottle or humidity tent.

{: .step}
### Inspect fruiting block
The fruiting block should be 80% - 100% colonized and free of contamination. If any contaminants (e.g., black or green mold) are visible, take a picture and contact us for a replacement. Some species release a brown/yellow liquid, this is a byproduct of the decomposition process of the substrate, this is normal and not considered contamination.

### Fruiting
Cut a slit or an X on one of the sides of your fruting block, it should be 2-3 inches wide, most mushrooms prefer to grow to the side, but some species do well growing upwards. Then provide fruiting conditions.
* **Light**: Place the container in indirect sunlight or under a 12-hour light cycle.
* **Humidity**: Maintain high humidity (80‚Äì95%) using a humidity tent or by spraying the opening 2-3 times per day.
* **Fresh Air Exchange**: Ensure adequate ventilation to prevent CO2 buildup (open air holes or fan lightly).
* **Temperature**: Keep in an area that provides comfortable temperatures.  Most species do well in temperature ranges 65‚Äì75¬∞F.

### Harvesting
When your mushrooms are ready, gently twist and pull them from the substrate or cut them at the base with a clean knife.

Avoid leaving stem remnants, as this can lead to contamination.

### Rehydrate for Additional Flushes

After harvesting, the substrate may produce more mushrooms (flushes).
* Rehydrate by soaking the substrate block in clean, non-chlorinated water for several hours or overnight.
* Drain excess water and return it to the fruiting environment.

Repeat the fruiting process, although subsequent flushes may produce fewer mushrooms.
