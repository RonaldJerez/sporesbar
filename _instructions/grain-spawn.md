Grain spawn is a fundamental component in mushroom cultivation, consisting of sterilized grains—such as oats, rye, wheat, or millet—that have been inoculated with mushroom mycelium. This mixture serves as a nutrient-rich medium, promoting robust mycelial growth and facilitating the transfer to bulk substrates like straw or compost for mushroom production.

### What you'll need
- Inoculated grain spawn.
- Substrate: (e.g., coco coir, straw, sawdust, or manure-based substrate, depending on the mushroom species).
- Container for fruiting: A monotub, grow bag, or other suitable fruiting chamber.
- Sterile tools: Gloves, alcohol wipes, and a clean workspace.
- Optional: Humidity tent or spray bottle for maintaining moisture levels.

### Inspect the grain spawn bag
The grains should be completely covered with white mycelium and free of contaminants. If any contaminants (e.g., green mold) are visible, take a picture and contact us for a replacement.

### Mix spawn and substrate
Work in a clean area, wearing gloves disinfected with alcohol. Break up the colonized grains by massaging the bag gently before opening. Open the grain spawn bag carefully to avoid contamination. Layer or mix the spawn with the prepared substrate. You should be able to use about half a pound per 5lb block of substrate. When using straw, layer the spawn in between multiple layers of straw for quicker colonization.
