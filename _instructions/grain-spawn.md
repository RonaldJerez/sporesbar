Grain spawn is a fundamental component in mushroom cultivation, consisting of sterilized grains‚Äîsuch as oats, rye, wheat, or millet‚Äîthat have been inoculated with mushroom mycelium. This mixture serves as a nutrient-rich medium, promoting robust mycelial growth and facilitating the transfer to bulk substrates like straw or compost for mushroom production.

Enjoy your mushroom-growing journey! üå±üçÑ

### What you'll need
- Inoculated grain spawn.
- Substrate: (e.g., coco coir, straw, sawdust, or manure-based substrate, depending on the mushroom species).
- Sterile tools: Gloves, alcohol wipes, and a clean workspace.

### Inspect the grain spawn bag
The grains should be completely covered with white mycelium and free of contaminants. If any contaminants (e.g., green mold) are visible, take a picture and contact us for a replacement.

### Prepare the substrate
Mushrooms need a base substrate before they can fruit.  You'll need to prepare your substrate of choice and add your grain spawn to it. Almost all mushrooms will grow on wood pellet (sawdust) bags. However, some mushrooms like oysters will do great with straw or coffee grounds. The followin

#### Can grow on straw:

* Blue Oysters
* Pearl Oysters
* Pink Oysters
* Yellow Oysters

#### Must be grown on sawdust:

* Lions Mane
* Shiitake
* King Oysters

There are many instructions online on how to prepare your substrate.  FreshCap has a great [guide that you can follow](https://learn.freshcap.com/growing/understanding-mushrooms-substrates/).

{: .step}
### Mix spawn and substrate
Work in a clean area, wearing gloves disinfected with alcohol. Break up the colonized grains by massaging the bag gently before opening. Open the grain spawn bag carefully to avoid contamination. Layer or mix the spawn with the prepared substrate. You should be able to use about half a pound per 5lb block of substrate, the more you use per bag the quicker it will colonize. When using straw, layer the spawn in between multiple layers of straw for quicker colonization.

### Incubation
Place the container in a dark or dimly lit area with a temperature suitable for the species (commonly 68‚Äì75¬∞F). Wait for the mycelium to colonize the substrate fully. This takes 1-3 weeks depending on the species.

{: .step}
### Fruiting
Once fully colonized, cut a slit or an X if you're using a grow bag and introduce fruiting conditions.
